#exercise 1
# write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". Once "done" is entered, print out the total, count and average of # the numbers. if the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except an print an error message and skip to 
# the next number.

def calculator():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    while True:
        num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
        if num == 'done':
            print total, count, (total / count)
            break
        else:
            try:
                total += float(num)
            except:
                print "Invalid input"
                continue
        count += 1
